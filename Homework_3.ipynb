They stay outside during the day, and sleep in their beds downstairs at night. They are both full of sugar - but if you have a fear of dogs then this place is not for you(URL HIDDEN)\\nLocation:\\nIt is literally right next to a brand new grocery store but you wouldn't know it from the back yard. It is 10-15 minutes from La Cantera - the gorgeous outdoor shopping mall. As well as Six Flags Fiesta Texas and UTSA. It is 5-10 minutes from the medical center area where all the hospitals are. It is 3 miles from IH-10, which is the main highway to get to downtown where the Riverwalk is (about 20 minutes by car).
