# ADM-HW3 Group#6
# Homework 3 - Find the perfect place to stay in Texas!

# NOTE: We'd forgotten to upload the dictionary datasets, so we just uploaded recently after the deadline. However we make no changes in the main ipynb file and function file.

### Dataset
The data set is available at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/airbnb-property-data-from-texas)
### Additional data
ALso in this homework we used data that was extracted by PromptCloudâ€™s Data-as-a-Service solution for the
Texas state of the USA. It contains some information about rental prices in different cities in Texas.

### Task
This homework requires us to divide each line of the data into tsv file, then create a conjunctive search engine (for most of the parts) through these files to get the wanted result.

#### Remark: 
If you have trouble viewing the maps on github, please use the [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
